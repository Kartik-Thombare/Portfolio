    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>
      My favorite movie of all time. It's a Japanese animated movie that is
      about a girl who gets lost in a spirit world. It's a very beautiful movie
      and I love the story and the characters.

    <h3>Toy Story</h3>
    <p>
      My second favorite movie of all time. It's a Pixar movie about toys that
      come to life when people aren't around. It's a very funny movie and I love
      the characters.

    <h3>Up</h3>
    <p>
      My third favorite movie of all time. It's a Pixar movie about an old man
      who goes on an adventure with a young boy. It's a very touching movie and
      I love the characters.
